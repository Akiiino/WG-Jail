# This config would cause problems with the `grep | source` approach:
#
# 1. The comment on line 10 contains "DNS" and "Address" substrings,
#    which grep -e "DNS" -e "Address" would match.
#
# 2. PostUp contains "Endpoint" as a substring.
#
# 3. There's a value with shell metacharacters in a PostUp that
#    grep+source would try to execute.
